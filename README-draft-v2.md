# I just want to help people do what they're good at.

I'm Sergio. I'm a data architect at a public agency that serves children and families in Alameda County. Before that I spent four years building data infrastructure at an EdTech nonprofit. Before that, a bunch of other roles that all had the same shape: someone has data, they know what it should tell them, but there's a gap between knowing and doing. I like closing that gap.

I also run [tacosdedatos](https://tacosdedatos.com), a newsletter and community about data and AI, entirely in Spanish. It's been going since 2018. Over 20,000 people follow it, and it exists because most of the best resources in this space are in English, and they shouldn't only be in English.

On the side, I build things. Some of them are products, some of them are experiments, most of them started as "what if I just tried this." An IoT system for food businesses. A pedagogical engine that reasons about how people learn. A journaling system that runs on a Raspberry Pi with no screen. An online course platform where every student gets real attention, not just content. A lesson design workbench for educators. They're all different and they're all the same idea: give people better tools to do what they already know how to do.

I'm from Tijuana. I live in the Bay Area. I've been building from both sides for a while now.
