# I just want to help people do what they're good at.

I'm Sergio. I've spent the last ten years closing the gap between "we have the data" and "we know what to do with it." Right now I'm a data architect at a public agency in Alameda County that serves children and families — the kind of place where the work matters and the resources are always tight. Before that, four years building data infrastructure at an EdTech nonprofit connecting multilingual families with schools. The through line has always been the same: mission-driven organizations that know what they need but don't have the bandwidth to build it.

I've been running [tacosdedatos](https://tacosdedatos.com) since 2018 — a newsletter and community about data and AI, entirely in Spanish, because most of the best resources in this space only exist in English and that's a problem worth fixing. Over 20,000 people follow it. It started as a side project and became the thing I'm most proud of.

On the side, I build things. [Relod](https://relod.app) is an IoT system for food businesses — ESP32 sensors and consumption forecasting for cafés and bars. [Hey Maestro](https://heymaestro.app) is an AI teaching partner for educators. [En Paralelo](https://enparalelo.org) is an online course platform where I'm solving the problem I've always had with selling courses — I don't want to sell content to 100,000 people and pretend that counts as teaching. [Fieldnotes](https://fieldnotes.my) is a lesson design workbench. There's also a journaling system running on a Raspberry Pi with no screen, but that one's harder to explain in a sentence.

All of this lives under [Brasas & Nube Studio](https://bns.studio), which is less of a company and more of a creative lab where I build whatever I think should exist.

I'm from Tijuana. I live in the Bay Area. You can find more at [soyserg.io](https://soyserg.io).
