# I just want to help people do what they're good at.

I'm Sergio — data architect, builder, and the person behind a bunch of projects that all circle back to the same idea: people deserve better tools, better access, and better systems to do meaningful work.

I build data infrastructure for a public agency serving children and families. I write about AI and data in Spanish for 20,000+ people. I make things that probably shouldn't work together — IoT sensors for cafés, AI teaching assistants, journaling systems on Raspberry Pis — but they do, because the thread connecting them is always the same.

Amplify people. Get out of their way.
